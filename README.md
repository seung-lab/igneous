Igneous is a [TaskQueue](https://github.com/seung-lab/python-task-queue) and CloudVolume based pipeline for producing and managing visualizable Neuroglancer [Precomputed](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer/tree/master/src/neuroglancer/datasource/precomputed) volumes. It uses [CloudVolume](https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume) for accessing data on AWS S3, Google Storage, or the local filesystem. It can operate in the cloud using an [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) task queuing system or run locally on a single machine or cluster (using a file based SQS emulation). 

Igneous is useful for downsampling, transferring, deleting, meshing, and skeletonizing large images. There are a few more esoteric functions too. You can watch a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyQGQtw2WIE) here.

## Pre-Built Docker Container

You can use this container for scaling big jobs horizontally or to experiment with Igneous within the container.  

https://hub.docker.com/r/seunglab/igneous/

## Installation

You'll need Python 3, pip, (possibly) a C++ compiler (e.g. g++ or clang), and virtualenv. It's tested under Ubuntu 16.04 and Mac OS Monterey. 

```bash
pip install igneous-pipeline
```

### Manual Installation

Sometimes it's useful to tweak tasks for special circumstances, and so you'll want to use a developer installation.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:seung-lab/igneous.git
cd igneous
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
```

*Igneous is intended as a self-contained pipeline system and not as a library. Such uses are possible, but not supported. If specific functionality is needed, please open an issue and we can break that out into a library as has been done with several algorithms such as [tinybrain](https://github.com/seung-lab/tinybrain), [zmesh](https://github.com/seung-lab/zmesh), and [kimimaro](https://github.com/seung-lab/kimimaro).*  

## Sample Local Use

Below we show three ways to use Igneous on a local workstation or cluster. As an example, we generate meshes for an already-existing Precomputed segmentation volume.

### In Memory Queue (Simple Execution)

This procedure is good for running small jobs as it is very simple, allows you to make use of parallelization, but on the downside it is brittle. If a job fails, you may have to restart the entire task set.

```python
from taskqueue import LocalTaskQueue
import igneous.task_creation as tc

# Mesh on 8 cores, use True to use all cores
cloudpath = 'gs://bucket/dataset/labels'
tq = LocalTaskQueue(parallel=8)
tasks = tc.create_meshing_tasks(cloudpath, mip=3, shape=(256, 256, 256))
tq.insert(tasks)
tq.execute()
tasks = tc.create_mesh_manifest_tasks(cloudpath)
tq.insert(tasks)
tq.execute()
print("Done!")
```

### Filesystem Queue (Producer-Consumer)

This procedure is more robust as tasks can be restarted if they fail. The queue is written to the filesystem and as such can be used by any processor that can read and write files to the selected directory. Thus, there is the potential for local cluster processing. Conceptually, a single producer script populates a filesystem queue ("FileQueue") and then typically one worker per a core consumes each task. The FileQueue allows for leasing a task for a set amount of time. If the task is not completed, it recycles into the available task pool. The order with which tasks are consumed is not guaranteed, but is approximately FIFO (a random task is selected from the next 100 to avoid conflicts) if all goes well. 

This mode is very new, so please report any issues. You can read about the queue design [here](https://github.com/seung-lab/python-task-queue/wiki/FileQueue-Design). In particular, we expect you may see problems with NFS or other filesystems that have problems with networked file locking. However, purely local use should generally be issue free. You can read more tips on using FileQueue [here](https://github.com/seung-lab/python-task-queue#notes-on-file-queue). You can remove a FileQueue by deleting its containing directory.

#### Producer Script

```python
from taskqueue import TaskQueue
import igneous.task_creation as tc

# Mesh on 8 cores, use True to use all cores
cloudpath = 'gs://bucket/dataset/labels'
tq = TaskQueue("fq:///path/to/queue/directory")
tasks = tc.create_meshing_tasks(cloudpath, mip=3, shape=(256, 256, 256))
tq.insert(tasks)
tq.execute()
tasks = tc.create_mesh_manifest_tasks(cloudpath)
tq.insert(tasks)
tq.execute()
print("Tasks created!")
```

#### Consumer Script

```python
from taskqueue import TaskQueue
import igneous.tasks # magic import needed to provide task definitions

tq = TaskQueue("fq:///path/to/queue/directory")
tq.poll(
  verbose=True, # prints progress
  lease_seconds=600, # allow exclusive 10 min per task
  tally=True # makes tq.completed work, logs 1 byte per completed task
)
```

## Sample Cloud Use

Igneous is intended to be used with Kubernetes (k8s). A pre-built docker container is located on DockerHub as `seunglab/igneous`. A sample `deployment.yml` (used with `kubectl create -f deployment.yml`) is located in the root of the repository.  

As Igneous is based on [CloudVolume](https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume), you'll need to create a `google-secret.json` or `aws-secret.json` to access buckets located on these services. 

You'll need to create an Amazon SQS queue to store the tasks you generate. Google's TaskQueue was previously supported but the API changed. It may be supported in the future.

### Populating the SQS Queue

There's a bit of an art to achieving high performance on SQS. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/seung-lab/python-task-queue#how-to-achieve-high-performance).

```python
import sys
from taskqueue import TaskQueue
import igneous.task_creation as tc

cloudpath = sys.argv[1]

# Get qurl from the SQS queue metadata, visible on the web dashboard when you click on it.
tq = TaskQueue("sqs://queue-url")
tasks = tc.create_downsampling_tasks(
  cloudpath, mip=0, 
  fill_missing=True, preserve_chunk_size=True
)
tq.insert(tasks)
print("Done!")
```

### Executing Tasks in the Cloud

The following instructions are for Google Container Engine, but AWS has similar tools.

```bash
# Create a Kubernetes cluster
# e.g. 

export PROJECT_NAME=example
export CLUSTER_NAME=example
export NUM_NODES=5 # arbitrary

# Create a Google Container Cluster
gcloud container --project $PROJECT_NAME clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME --zone "us-east1-b" --machine-type "n1-standard-16" --image-type "GCI" --disk-size "50" --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/taskqueue","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/servicecontrol","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management.readonly","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append" --num-nodes $NUM_NODES --network "default" --enable-cloud-logging --no-enable-cloud-monitoring

# Bind the kubectl command to this cluster
gcloud config set container/cluster $CLUSTER_NAME

# Give the cluster permission to read and write to your bucket
# You only need to include services you'll actually use.
kubectl create secret generic secrets \
--from-file=$HOME/.cloudvolume/secrets/google-secret.json \
--from-file=$HOME/.cloudvolume/secrets/aws-secret.json \
--from-file=$HOME/.cloudvolume/secrets/boss-secret.json 

# Create a Kubernetes deployment
kubectl create -f deployment.yml # edit deployment.yml in root of repo

# Resizing the cluster
gcloud container clusters resize $CLUSTER_NAME --num-nodes=20 # arbitrary node count
kubectl scale deployment igneous --replicas=320 # 16 * nodes b/c n1-standard-16 has 16 cores

# Spinning down

# Important: This will leave the kubernetes master running which you
# will be charged for. You can also fully delete the cluster.
gcloud container clusters resize $CLUSTER_NAME --num-nodes=0
kubectl delete deployment igneous
```

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

Igneous also comes with a command line interface for performing some routine tasks. We currently support `downsample`, `xfer`, `mesh`, `skeleton`, and `execute` and plan to add more Igneous functions as well. Check `igneous --help` to see the current menu of functions and their options. 

The principle of the CLI is specify a source layer, a destination layer (if applicable), and a [TaskQueue](https://github.com/seung-lab/python-task-queue) (e.g. `sqs://` or `fq://`). First, populate the queue with the correct task type and then execute against it.

The CLI is intended to handle typical tasks that aren't too complex. If your task gets weird, it's time to try scripting!

```bash
igneous image downsample gs://my-lab/data --mip 0 --queue ./my-queue
igneous execute ./my-queue

igneous --help 
```

For those that have been using Igneous a long time, `igneous execute` can replace `python igneous/task_execution.py`.

### Downsampling (DownsampleTask)

*Requires compiled tinybrain library.*  

For any but the very smallest volumes, it's desirable to create smaller summary images of what may be multi-gigabyte 
2D slices. The purpose of these summary images is make it easier to visualize the dataset or to work with lower
resolution data in the context of a data processing (e.g. ETL) pipeline.

Image (uint8, microscopy) datasets are typically downsampled in an recursive hierarchy using 2x2x1 average pooling. Segmentation (uint8-uint64, labels) datasets (i.e. human ground truth or machine labels) are downsampled using 2x2x1 mode pooling in a recursive hierarchy using the [COUNTLESS algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/countless-high-performance-2x-downsampling-of-labeled-images-using-python-and-numpy-e70ad3275589). This means that mip 1 segmentation labels are exact mode computations, but subsequent ones may not be. Under this scheme, the space taken by downsamples will be at most 33% of the highest resolution image's storage.

Whether image or segmentation type downsampling will be used is determined from the neuroglancer info file's "type" attribute.

#### CLI Downsample

Here we show an example where we insert the tasks to downsample 4 mip levels using 2x2x1 pooling into a queue and process it. Then we insert the tasks to downsample from mip 4 up to mip 7 using 2x2x2 downsamples that ignores background to avoid ghosted images when multiple Z are combined.

```bash
PATH=gs://mydataset/layer 
QUEUE=fq://./my-queue # could also be sqs://

igneous image downsample $PATH --mip 0 --num-mips 4 --queue $QUEUE # downsample 2x2x1
igneous execute $QUEUE # process the queue
igneous image downsample $PATH --mip 4 --num-mips 3 --volumetric --sparse --queue $QUEUE # superdownsample w/ 2x2x2 sparse
igneous image downsample $PATH --mip 0 --queue $QUEUE --sharded # sharded downsample
igneous image downsample $PATH --queue $QUEUE --zrange 0,1 # downsample only a single slice 
igneous execute $QUEUE # process the queue
```

#### Scripting Downsample

```python
tasks = create_downsampling_tasks(
    layer_path, # e.g. 'gs://bucket/dataset/layer'
    mip=0, # Start downsampling from this mip level (writes to next level up)
    fill_missing=False, # Ignore missing chunks and fill them with black
    axis='z', 
    num_mips=5, # number of downsamples to produce. Downloaded shape is chunk_size * 2^num_mip
    chunk_size=None, # manually set chunk size of next scales, overrides preserve_chunk_size
    preserve_chunk_size=True, # use existing chunk size, don't halve to get more downsamples
    sparse=False, # for sparse segmentation, allow inflation of pixels against background
    bounds=None, # mip 0 bounding box to downsample 
    encoding=None # e.g. 'raw', 'compressed_segmentation', etc
    delete_black_uploads=False, # issue a delete instead of uploading files containing all background
    background_color=0, # Designates the background color
    compress='gzip', # None, 'gzip', and 'br' (brotli) are options
    factor=(2,2,1), # common options are (2,2,1) and (2,2,2)
  )

# for sharded downsample (only 1 mip at a time)
tasks = create_image_shard_downsample_tasks(
  cloudpath, mip=0, fill_missing=False, 
  sparse=False, chunk_size=None,
  encoding=None, memory_target=MEMORY_TARGET,
  agglomerate=False, timestamp=None,
  factor=(2,2,1)
)
```

### Data Transfer / Rechunking (TransferTask)

A common task is to take a dataset that was set up as single slices (X by Y by 1) chunks. This is often appropriate
for image alignment or other single section based processing tasks. However, this is not optimal for Neuroglancer
visualization or for achieving the highest performance over TCP networking (e.g. with [CloudVolume](https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume)). Therefore, it can make sense to rechunk the dataset to create deeper and overall larger chunks (e.g. 64x64x64, 128x128x32, 128x128x64). In some cases, it can also be desirable to translate the coordinate system of a data layer. 

The `TransferTask` will automatically run the first few levels of downsampling as well, making it easier to
visualize progress and reducing the amount of work a subsequent `DownsampleTask` will need to do.

Another use case is to transfer a neuroglancer dataset from one cloud bucket to another, but often the cloud
provider's transfer service will suffice, even across providers. 

#### CLI Transfer

Here's an example where we transfer from a source to destination dataset. There are many options available, see `igneous xfer --help`.

```bash
igneous image xfer $SRC $DEST --queue $QUEUE
igneous image xfer $SRC $DEST --queue $QUEUE --sharded
igneous -p 4 execute $QUEUE
```

We have developed some calculation aids to help you pick the right shape for the transfer task.

```bash
igneous design ds-shape gs://bucket/dataset --shape 1024,1024,64 --factor 2,2,1
>>> 715.8 MB

igneous design ds-memory gs://bucket/dataset 3.5e9 --verbose
>>> Data Width: 8
>>> Factor: (2, 2, 1)
>>> Chunk Size: 512, 512, 16
>>> Memory Limit: 3.5 GB
>>> -----
>>> Optimized Shape: 4096,4096,16
>>> Downsamples: 3
>>> Memory Used*: 2.9 GB
>>> 
>>> *memory used is for retaining the image and all downsamples.
>>> Additional costs may be incurred from processing.
```

#### Scripting Transfer

```python
tasks = create_transfer_tasks(
  src_layer_path, dest_layer_path, 
  chunk_size=None, shape=None, 
  fill_missing=False, translate=None,
  bounds=None, mip=0, preserve_chunk_size=True,
  encoding=None, skip_downsamples=False,
  delete_black_uploads=False, background_color=0,
  agglomerate=False, timestamp=None, compress='gzip',
  factor=None, sparse=False, dest_voxel_offset=None,
  memory_target=3.5e9, max_mips=5
)

# To create a sharded volume from a non-sharded volume
tasks = create_image_shard_transfer_tasks(
  src_layer_path, dst_layer_path,
  mip=0, chunk_size=None,
  encoding=None, bounds=None, fill_missing=False,
  translate=(0, 0, 0), dest_voxel_offset=None,
  agglomerate=False, timestamp=None,
  memory_target=3.5e9,
)
```

Most of the options here are the same as for downsample. The major exceptions are `shape` and `skip_downsamples`. `shape` designates the size of a single transfer task and must be chunk aligned. The number of downsamples that will be generated can be computed as log2(`shape` / `chunk_size`). `skip_downsamples` will prevent downsamples from being generated. 

Due to the memory constraints, sharded tasks do not automatically generate downsamples.

### Deletion (DeleteTask)  

If you want to parallelize deletion of an image layer in a bucket beyond using e.g. `gsutil -m rm`, you can 
horizontally scale out deleting using these tasks. Note that the tasks assume that the information to be deleted
is chunk aligned and named appropriately. 

#### CLI 

```python
igneous image rm $LAYER --queue $QUEUE
igneous execute $QUEUE
```

#### Scripting


```python
tasks = create_deletion_tasks(
  layer_path, # data layer to target
  mip=0, # Which layer to start deleting from
  num_mips=5, # How many mip levels above to delete (limited by shape)
  shape=None, # (optional) size of an individual deletion task (must be chunk aligned)
  bounds=None # Delete only part of a dataset by specifying a cloudvolume.Bbox
)
```

### Meshing (MeshTask & MeshManifestTask)

*Requires compiled zmesh library.*  

Meshing is a two stage process. First, the dataset is divided up into a regular grid of tasks that will be meshed independently of
each other using the `MeshTask`. The resulting mesh fragments are uploaded to the destination layer's meshing directory 
(named something like `mesh_mip_3_err_40`). 

There are two ways do conduct meshing. The standard "unsharded" way can generate a lot of mesh fragment files. It scales to about 100M labels before it starts incurring unreasonable costs on cloud systems. To handle larger volumes, there is the somwhat more difficult to use sharded meshing process that condenses the number of files by orders of magnitude.

Multi-Resolution meshes are supported. Specify the desired number of levels of detail and up to that number will be generated per a mesh (if the mesh is large enough to need it based on the chunk size). Levels of detail are generated by simplifying the base mesh with [pyfqmr](https://github.com/Kramer84/pyfqmr-Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Reduction) with successively more aggressive parameters.

#### Unsharded Meshing

Without additional processing, Neuroglancer has no way of 
knowing the names of these chunks (which will be named something like `$SEGID:0:$BOUNDING_BOX` e.g. `1052:0:0-512_0-512_0-512`). 
The `$BOUNDING_BOX` part of the name is arbitrary and is the convention used by igneous because it is convenient for debugging.

The manually actuated second stage runs the `MeshManifestTask` which generates files named `$SEGID:0` which contains a short JSON snippet like `{ "fragments": [ "1052:0:0-512_0-512_0-512" ] }`. This file tells Neuroglancer and CloudVolume which mesh files to download when accessing a given segment ID.

If multiple levels of detail are specified, the mesh files will be organized differently as they will be using the newer container format.

#### Sharded Meshing

Sharded Meshes are not only condensed, but also draco encoded with an integer position attribute. The files must be initially meshed and then a set of meshes gathered into the memory of a single machine which can then synthesize the shard file. This requires more time and memory to generate than unsharded meshes, but simplifies management of the resultant data set by creating far fewer files. The shard files have names like `a31.shard`. A sharded dataset is indicated by the info file in the mesh directory having `{ "@type": "neuroglancer_multilod_draco" }`. 

#### CLI Meshing

The CLI supports only standard Precomputed. Graphene is not currently supported. There are many more options, check out `igneous mesh --help`, `igneous mesh forge --help`, and `igneous mesh merge --help`.

```bash
# Standard Unsharded Meshing, set nlod > 0 for additional lower levels of detail
igneous mesh forge $PATH --mip 2 --queue $QUEUE
igneous execute $QUEUE
igneous mesh merge $PATH --magnitude 2 --queue $QUEUE --nlod 0
igneous execute $QUEUE

# Sharded Meshing, set nlod > 0 for additional lower levels of detail
igneous mesh forge $PATH --mip 2 --queue $QUEUE --sharded 
igneous execute $QUEUE
igneous mesh merge-sharded $PATH --queue $QUEUE --nlod 0
igneous execute $QUEUE
```

#### Scripting Meshing

```python
tasks = create_meshing_tasks(             # First Pass
  layer_path, # Which data layer 
  mip, # Which resolution level to mesh at (we often choose near isotropic resolutions)
  shape=(448, 448, 448), # Size of a task to mesh, chunk alignment not needed
  simplification=True, # Whether to enable quadratic edge collapse mesh simplification
  max_simplification_error=40, # Maximum physical deviation of mesh vertices during simplification
  mesh_dir=None, # Optionally choose a non-default location for saving meshes 
  cdn_cache=False, # Disable caching in the cloud so updates aren't painful to view
  dust_threshold=None, # Don't bother meshing below this number of voxels
  object_ids=None, # Optionally, only mesh these labels.
  progress=False, # Display a progress bar (more useful locally than in the cloud)
  fill_missing=False, # If part of the data is missing, fill with zeros instead of raising an error 
  encoding='precomputed' # 'precomputed' or 'draco' (don't change this unless you know what you're doing)
  spatial_index=True, # generate a spatial index for querying meshes by bounding box
  sharded=False, # generate intermediate shard fragments for later processing into sharded format
) 
tasks = create_mesh_manifest_tasks(layer_path, magnitude=3) # Second Pass
```

The parameters above are mostly self explainatory, but the magnitude parameter of `create_mesh_manifest_tasks` is a bit odd. What a MeshManifestTask does is iterate through a proportion of the files defined by a filename prefix. `magnitude` splits up the work by 
an additional 10^magnitude. A high magnitude (3-5+) is appropriate for horizontal scaling workloads while small magnitudes 
(1-2) are more suited for small volumes locally processed since there is overhead introduced by splitting up the work.  

Of note: Meshing is a memory intensive operation. The underlying zmesh library has an optimization for meshing volumes smaller than 1024 voxels on the X and Y dimensions and 512 in Z which could be helpful to take advantage of. Meshing time scales with the number of labels contained in the volume.

### Skeletonization (SkeletonTask, SkeletonMergeTask)

Igneous provides the engine for performing out-of-core skeletonization of labeled images. 
The in-core part of the algorithm is provided by the [Kimimaro](https://github.com/seung-lab/kimimaro) library.  

The strategy is to apply Kimimaro mass skeletonization to 1 voxel overlapping chunks of the segmentation and then fuse them in a second pass. Both sharded and unsharded formats are supported. For very large datasets, note that sharded runs better on a local cluster as it can make use of `mmap`.

#### CLI Skeletonization

The CLI for skeletonization is similar to meshing. Graphene is not supported. However, both sharded and unsharded formats are. 

```bash
# Unsharded Example
igneous skeleton forge $PATH --mip 2 --queue $QUEUE --scale 2.5 --const 10
igneous execute $QUEUE
igneous skeleton merge $PATH --queue $QUEUE --tick-threshold 500 --max-cable-length 10000000
igneous execute $QUEUE

# Sharded Example
igneous skeleton forge $PATH --mip 2 --queue $QUEUE --scale 2.5 --const 10 --sharded
igneous execute $QUEUE
igneous skeleton merge-sharded $PATH --queue $QUEUE --tick-threshold 500 --max-cable-length 10000000 --minishard-bits 7 --shard-bits 3 --preshift-bits 4
igneous execute $QUEUE
```

#### Scripting Skeletonization

```python
import igneous.task_creation as tc 

# First Pass: Generate Skeletons
tasks = tc.create_skeletonizing_tasks(
    cloudpath, 
    mip, # Which resolution to skeletionize at (near isotropic is often good)
    shape=Vec(512, 512, 512), # size of individual skeletonizing tasks (not necessary to be chunk aligned)
    sharded=False, # Generate (true) concatenated .frag files (False) single skeleton fragments
    spatial_index=False, # Generate a spatial index so skeletons can be queried by bounding box
    info=None, # provide a cloudvolume info file if necessary (usually not)
    fill_missing=False, # Use zeros if part of the image is missing instead of raising an error

    # see Kimimaro's documentation for the below parameters
    teasar_params={'scale':10, 'const': 10}, 
    object_ids=None, # Only skeletonize these ids
    mask_ids=None, # Mask out these ids
    fix_branching=True, # (True) higher quality branches at speed cost
    fix_borders=True, # (True) Enable easy stitching of 1 voxel overlapping tasks 
    dust_threshold=1000, # Don't skeletonize below this physical distance
    progress=False, # Show a progress bar
    parallel=1, # Number of parallel processes to use (more useful locally)
    spatial_index=True, # generate a spatial index for querying skeletons by bounding box
    sharded=False, # generate intermediate shard fragments for later processing into sharded format
  )

# Second Pass: Fuse Skeletons (unsharded version)
tasks = tc.create_unsharded_skeleton_merge_tasks(
  layer_path, mip, 
  crop=0, # in voxels
  magnitude=3, # same as mesh manifests
  dust_threshold=4000, # in nm
  tick_threshold=6000, # in nm
  delete_fragments=False # Delete scratch files from first stage 
)

# Second Pass: Fuse Skeletons (sharded version)
tasks = tc.create_sharded_skeleton_merge_tasks(
  layer_path, # mip is automatically derived from info file
  dust_threshold=1000, 
  tick_threshold=3500, 
  shard_index_bytes=2**13,
  minishard_index_bytes=2**15,
  minishard_index_encoding='gzip', # or None 
  data_encoding='gzip' # or None
  max_cable_length=None, 
  spatial_index_db=None
)
```

### Contrast Normalization (LuminanceLevelsTask & ContrastNormalizationTask)

Sometimes a dataset's luminance values cluster into a tight band and make the image unnecessarily bright or dark and above all
low contrast. Sometimes the data may be 16 bit, but the values cluster all at the low end, making it impossible to even see without
using ImageJ / Fiji or another program that supports automatic image normalization. Furthermore, Fiji can only go so far on a 
Teravoxel or Petavoxel dataset. 

The object of these tasks are to first create a representative sample of the luminance levels of a dataset per a Z slice (i.e. a frequency count of gray values). This levels information is then used to perform per Z section contrast normalization. In the future, perhaps we will attempt global normalization. The algorithm currently in use reads the levels files for a given Z slice,
determines how much of the ends of the distribution to lop off, perhaps 1% on each side (you should plot the levels files for your own data as this is configurable, perhaps you might choose 0.5% or 0.25%). The low value is recentered at 0, and the high value is stretched to 255 (in the case of uint8s) or 65,535 (in the case of uint16).

#### CLI Contrast Normalization

```bash
# first pass: create per z-slice histogram
igneous image contrast histogam $PATH --queue $QUEUE --coverage 0.01 --mip 0
# second pass: apply histogram equalization
igneous image contrast equalize $PATH --queue $QUEUE --clip-fraction 0.01 --mip 0
```

#### Scripting Contrast Normalization

```python
# first pass: create per z-slice histogram
tasks = create_luminance_levels_tasks(layer_path, coverage_factor=0.01, shape=None, offset=(0,0,0), mip=0) 
# second pass: apply histogram equalization
tasks = create_contrast_normalization_tasks(src_path, dest_path, shape=None, mip=0, clip_fraction=0.01, fill_missing=False, translate=(0,0,0))
```

### Connected Components Labeling (CCL) (Beta!)

Igneous supports whole image connected components labeling of a segmentation. Currently, only 6-connected components are supported. The largest image currently supported would have 2^64 voxels (about 18 exavoxels or 18+ whole mouse brains). You can apply CCL to either a labeled image or to a grayscale image that can be binarized with a threshold.

The whole image CCL algorithm requires four steps that must be executed in order. The shape specified and optional binarization and dust thresholds *must* be the same for all steps nonsensical outputs will result. By default, the values will be consistent. To apply a binarization threshold, you can apply both or one of `--threshold-lte` (`<=`) and `--threshold-gte` (`>=`). You can also apply a `--dust` threshold to remove unwanted objects smaller than this threshold.

This capability is very new and may have some quirks, so please report any issues.

#### Scripting CCL

```python
import igneous.task_creation as tc
import igneous.tasks.image.ccl
tasks = tc.create_ccl_face_tasks( # Step 1
  cloudpath, mip, shape=(512,512,512),
  # optional, for grayscale images
  threshold_gte=None, threshold_lte=None,
  dust_threshold=0,
)
tasks = tc.create_ccl_equivalence_tasks( # Step 2
  cloudpath, mip, shape,
  threshold_gte, threshold_lte, 
  dust_threshold
)
# Step 3
# This is just a function to call, not a job to enqueue.
# It concentrates the equivalence data onto a single machine
# and uploads the relabelings for each grid point.
igneous.tasks.image.ccl.create_relabeling(src, mip, shape)

tasks = tc.create_ccl_relabel_tasks( # Step 4
  src_path, dest_path, 
  mip, shape=(512,512,512),
  chunk_size=None, encoding=None,
  threshold_gte=None,
  threshold_lte=None,
  dust_threshold=0,
)
```

#### CLI CCL

```bash
igneous image ccl faces SRC --mip 0 --queue queue
igneous execute -x queue
igneous image ccl links SRC --mip 0 --queue queue
igneous execute -x queue
igneous image ccl calc-labels SRC --mip 0 # computes relabeling
igneous image ccl relabel SRC DEST --mip 0 --queue queue --encoding compresso
igneous execute -x queue
igneous image ccl clean SRC # removes intermediate files
```

For smaller images that could reasonably be processed on a single machine there is a shortcut `auto` that will also automatically execute.

```bash
igneous -p PARALLEL image ccl auto SRC DEST --shape 512,512,512 --encoding compresso --queue queue
````

### Computing Per-Object Voxel Counts

This will create a [`MapBuffer`](https://github.com/seung-lab/mapbuffer) dictionary containing the global number of voxels per a label at the location `$CLOUDPATH/$KEY/stats/voxel_counts.mb`. You can then use this file to lookup the global voxel count for each label.

#### Scripting Voxel Counts

```python
import igneous.task_creation as tc

cloudpath = ... 
mip = 0
tasks = tc.create_voxel_counting_tasks(
  cloudpath, mip=mip
)
tq = LocalTaskQueue(parallel=1)
tq.insert_all(tasks)

tc.accumulate_voxel_counts(cloudpath, mip)

from cloudfiles import CloudFile
from mapbuffer import MapBuffer
cf = CloudFile("/".join(cloudpath, "stats", "voxel_counts.mb"))

fn = lambda x: int.from_bytes(x, byteorder='little')
# for (slow) remote access w/o having to download the file
mb = MapBuffer(cf, frombytesfn=fn)
# for fast local access, but downloads the whole file
mb = MapBuffer(cf.get(), frombytesfn=fn)
mb[label] # fetches voxel count for label
```

#### CLI Voxel Counts

```bash
igneous image voxels count SRC --mip 0 --queue queue
igneous execute -x queue
igneous image voxels sum SRC --mip 0 # no execution needed
```

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to everyone that has contributed to Igneous! I'll fill this section in more fully later, but in particular recent thanks to Jeremy Maitin-Shepard, David Ackermann, Hythem Sidky, and Sridhar Jagannathan for giving advice and sharing code for producing sharded multi-res meshes. Thanks to Chris Roat for improving the CLI's typing. Thanks to Nico Kemnitz for improving the original mesh task. Of course, thanks to lab alumni Ignacio Tartavull who started the project with me and provided its initial impetus.
